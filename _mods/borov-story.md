description: "Set between Clear Sky and Shadow of Chernobyl, Borov's Story tells the rise of Borov and how he became the bandit leader in Dark Valley. Starting as a small-time bartender, you'll gather your crew, rob stalkers, and challenge Yoga for control of the faction.<br>Build on the OGSR engine with the beautiful Autumn Aurora graphics, it's a stable, good looking mod that will run pretty well on low-spec computers. There's no trading or fancy mechanics here, just following a very linear main questline, looting the bodies of your ennemies for gear on the way.<br>The concept and premise of the mod are great, but the execution is just average: buggy companions, janky missions, poor weapon balance, and an overall weak storyline where Borov feels more like an errand boy than a rising crime boss. It's very short (~2-3hrs), so despite being flawed and uneven, it's still a fun and unique adventure, offering a bandit's perspective in the Zone."

### Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Make regular manual saves:** Mod is pretty janky and it's easy to get soft/hard locked out of the main quest
